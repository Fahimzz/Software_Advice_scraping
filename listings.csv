You do you
At Pointerpro, an assessment is never just an assessment. As a user, you’ll be able to create a large variety of formats, from maturity assessments and competence evaluations to self-assessments and quote calculators. Every organization is unique and we genuinely believe that should be reflected in the assessments you will be drawing up. Pointerpro allows you to design your very own tailor-made assessments.
Alternate between fixed and variable text, graphs and images, based on the respective answers of your respondent.
Knowledge is power
By drawing up your assessment, you are creating a knowledge gateway for individual users without lifting a finger.

Forget about time-consuming advisory sessions and provide respondents with a detailed and dynamic PDF-report, giving them the personalized feedback they would have wanted in the first place.
We all remember the days of filling out assessments, followed by a meaningless “thank you” towards the end, after which you would be waiting for advice that might not even come.
Well, the waiting game is over.
Respondents can receive instantaneous feedback and advice after filling out the respective assessment. No need for gated content or extra information, respondents can simply download a PDF after having completed the assessment.
It is time
It’s often at this point that the question arises: “Interesting, but what exactly can I use it for?”. As previously mentioned it can simply be used to save you and/or your organization time.
Time to focus on your own strategy, time to reach a larger audience through automated expertise, time to focus on your clients, you name it. Pointerpro gives you the opportunity to set you apart from the competition and shift your time to the things that matter the most, without losing your brand’s integrity.

Small Improvements is comprised of four integrated modules. Performance reviews let everyone, manager and employee alike, know where they stand, and offer both praise and hints to improve.
360-degree feedback allows employees to receive feedback from everyone - coworkers, manager and clients. Once this feedback is collected and the performance review is finished, Small Improvements gives users a way to create and track their personal development plan based on that feedback.
Companies with longer review cycles can use continuous feedback to send quick words of praise, propose ideas and make suggestions and comments, which can be both public or private, depending on the message and company culture.",,https://gdm-catalog-fmapi-prod.imgix.net/ProductScreenshot/14be3ad4-d1d7-4d87-baa6-0005dc99fbd9.png?w=240&h=180&fit=fill&fill=blur&auto=format&q=50,https://gdm-catalog-fmapi-prod.imgix.net/ProductScreenshot/ebe5e105-ddae-43a8-aa6e-7e2bb2c74843.png?w=240&h=180&fit=fill&fill=blur&auto=format&q=50,2024-03-25,360 Degree Feedback Software - 88,

It’s the only solution that guides learners step by step to master the specific capabilities of their roles that will accelerate organizational performance. Both leaders and learners are tired of uninspiring training and performance reviews. People crave paths to excellence but are sick of wasting time wading through mountains of content because someone said so. They’re learning outside of their organization’s LMS by interacting with peers — and that learning is lost.
Acorn captures things that are already happening and makes them easy to find. It facilitates knowledge transfer between employees and fosters a learning-in-the-flow culture where everyone helps each other get better. By presenting contextual learning opportunities while tightly linking learning and performance, Acorn equips people to grow and excel in precisely the ways that positively impact outcomes. Acorn enables companies, governments and other institutions worldwide to consistently align individual growth with business objectives through a performance-oriented LMS.
Designed to codify and operationalize capabilities to improve organizational efficiency, Acorn curates internal and third party sources and intelligently serves up the right learning recipe for each person’s betterment.

Acorn’s AI collects tangible evidence of behavior change, creating a comprehensive record of individual learning experiences mapped to their impact on performance. It facilitates continual employee assessment in a feedback loop that measures improvement not completions.

The first is that the feedback is transparent, i.e. it is not anonymous and is public.
The second characteristic is that the feedback is dynamic. This feature is imperative to establish a culture of feedback in the day-to-day work of the organisation as achieving change requires ""repetition"".
Finally, a good user experience: The simplification of the process maintains the quality and rigour of the 360° analysis.
The self-assessment is carried out by the individual himself/herself by selecting, from a total of 40 attributes, the top five strengths and one opportunity for improvement. In order to receive external feedback, the person invites other people to evaluate him/her using the same process.
The methodology has been developed based on the selection of the best 360º assessment tools available on the market and the in-depth knowledge of the strengths and opportunities for improvement of each of them.
What makes us unique?
· The purpose of the feedback is the well-being of individuals and groups by moving from relationships to emotional bonds.
· Two tools in one application: 360º test and continuous feedback through gratitude and recognition.
· Dynamic feedback (24/7)
· Good UX with better adoption and attachment.
· High participation leading to higher engagement.

Space Designer 3D lets anyone draw an architectural project in a few seconds.
The application is built as a modular platform – companies can add extensions, new tools and custom interfaces.
Every project automatically generates a customizable inventory list that includes multiple metrics, such as object dimensions, products, and quantities. The produced data can be personalized to business needs.
The product catalog is fully customizable.
More than a designing and visualization application, it is a communication channel between individuals and professionals.
Space Designer 3D is an ecosystem containing several applications in one. One of its goals is to attract clients on your website and entice them to stay longer, to interact with your product thanks to the 3D application. To achieve this interaction, we integrate the application on your website under a white label, allowing prospects to see in 2D and 3D. Prospects have to sign up to access their project, in which your product is displayed.
This interactive journey can be adapted depending on your business model in a lot of different ways. In any case, this system involves your prospects directly. They become active in the process, not passive. You offer them another way to shop from their home, an option where they can “manipulate” the product in 3D.
Your product can be a house plan, furniture items, a service like interior design… it can be both tangible and intangible.
The aim is for your prospect to go through a journey on your website, play with the application and end this journey with a purchase of your product. But even if the journey doesn’t end with a purchase, you have their contact information, which will allow you to get in touch with them and encourage them to either buy your product, or get in touch with you to help buy it.
